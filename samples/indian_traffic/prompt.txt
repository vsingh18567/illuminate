I am working for the government and we're trying to automate the fine collection process for traffic violations.

We have a dataset of all the traffic violations in the country with a few features. 

This is likely not sufficient to automate the fine collection process, but try and help us understand the factors that contribute to the fine amount and come up with a predictive model.
